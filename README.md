# Opening SSG files

As the YAML project in upstream SSG is not yet complete, use only the SSG files that are provided here.
Currently, the only SSG yaml files that can be read are `.rule`, `.group`, and `.profile`.

You can open a project by selecting the top level folder. For example:

File -> Open Project -> `select the husky folder`

If you prefer, you can choose the project folder by browsing to it in the file tree browser window
followed by double-clicking on the folder.

You can also open individual files. For example:

File -> Open -> `select a SSG YAML file`

If you prefer, you can choose to open SSG YAML files by double-clicking on them in the file tree browser window.
